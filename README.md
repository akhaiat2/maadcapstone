# Media Arts and Design Capstone Project

Project Proposal (inspired by Sarah Meyohas)

As someone who is a double-major in Economics and MAAD, I think itâ€™s important that my final project speaks to both sides of my 
academic experience at the University of Chicago. I have always loved the visual aspect of charts, especially those involving trading securities. 

My interest in financial charts stemmed mainly from my grandfather: I used to watch him for hours trading commodities on multiple monitors 
and watching huge fluctuations among the monitors. One day, I realized that my interested was from the visual and technological side instead 
of the underlying financial product. I could picture millions of people exchanging goods and services, affecting businesses and countries, and 
then having the effects of millions of people display elegantly and efficiently through a visually asthetic chart 

For my capstone project, I wanted to incorporate my vision of creating generative art in combination with stocks. 
I am looking to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with other APIs, to build a generative artwork that will combine the live stock price 
and volume of stocks while also distorting these measurements with algorithms based on financial models to picture the actions of millions 
of people through the digital canvas. 

The most ideal way to share my work will be through a website, and I envision my final output to be a combination of 
random stock prices and shapes created by underlying financial algorithms. (I want to create a financial dystopia, billboards displaying 
financial data, overwhelming amount of stock prices, charts related to the movement of money, audio with phones ringing and background music 
from a trading floor. I want to display the chaotic efficiency of the market visually through generative art.
